# Stacks & Queues Data Structure

As their name suggests, stacks and queues are extremely basic linear data-structures. 

## Similarities and Differences
They both have flexible sizes, e.g. they grow as more data is added to them, and shrink as data is taken away. These two, however, are different in the way data is removed from them. 


## Stacks
In a stack, the item that is added more recent will be first to go out. It has a `LIFO` or `Last in first out` data structure. It's like a stack in real life e.g. a stack of books where you will remove books from its top rather than bottom. 

 When an item/data is put in a stack, this action is called a `PUSH`. Contrary, if and item/data is taken out, we call it `POP`. These two actions are also the main functions used in a stack data-structure.


 ## QUeues=
In a QUeue, the Item that is added first will be the first to go out. It is a `FIFO` or `First in first out`. e.g. A line in a store, where the first who stands in the line would also be the first to pay the cashier and go out. 

When an Item/data is added to a queue, the action is called `ENQUEUE`. and when it leaves the queue, it would be `DEQUEUE`.
